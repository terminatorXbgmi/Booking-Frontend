The application provides a user-friendly interface for both users and administrators, allowing for efficient management of bookings, sports, and centers.

## Deployment Instructions
To deploy the backend application, we can use platforms like Render, Heroku, or DigitalOcean. Here I have used Render for deployment.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- The application assumes that the backend API is running and accessible.
- The application is designed for modern browsers and may not work on older versions.

## Special Instructions
- Ensure that the backend API URL is correctly set in the environment variables if needed.
- You may need to adjust CORS settings on the backend to allow requests from the frontend.
